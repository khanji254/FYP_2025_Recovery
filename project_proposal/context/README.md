# Context Materials Organization

Place all reference materials here for the project proposal.

## Files to Add:

1. **Interim Report** - The base document we're building on
2. **PowerPoint Presentation** - The proposal presentation
3. **Proposal Template** (unzipped) - Template files and PDF
4. **Erick Logbook** - Status quo and work completed

## Folder Structure:
```
context/
├── interim_report/
├── presentation/
├── template/
├── logbook/
└── README.md (this file)
```

Once files are placed here, they will be analyzed to extract:
- Project objectives
- Methodology
- Requirements
- Previous work
- Key findings
