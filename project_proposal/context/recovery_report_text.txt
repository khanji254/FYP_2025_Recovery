 Background [http://www.effectofglobalwarming.com/][http://www.iea.org/]Rocket Recovery: The most critical subsystem for preserving flight data and hardware.Evolution of Systems:Single Deployment: Parachute at apogee. Risk: High drift radius.Dual Deployment: Drogue at apogee (stability), Main at low altitude (soft landing). Standard for high-power rocketry .Nakuja Context:Previous N3.5 mission used a basic single-deployment piston based system.Current Uses Dual DeploymentChallenges faced: Reliability of ejection and telemetry signal loss .Image of N4 Recovery tsaken by student Dual recovery system from

 Problem StatementThe N4 mission faces three critical reliability challenges. First, the telemetry system's current protocol suffers from significant range limitations, leading to signal loss and high risk of vehicle loss. Second, the "DC dump" ignition method for nichrome wire generates uncontrolled heat 1000 degrees, which makes the deployment a one use case. Finally, the lack of real-time pre-flight feedback on battery voltage and igniter continuity leaves ground operators blind to potential power failures, increasing the risk of aborts or deployment malfunctions.Image of N4 charge holder taken by student RSSI data from range test

 Literature Review: DeploymentIgniter Types:Commercial E-Matches: Reliable and fast, but expensive and single-use.Nichrome Wire (DIY): Reusable and cheap. Used by Nakuja.Nakuja N4 Analysis:Method: Direct DC Drive (14.8V dumped into wire)4.Failure Mode: Wire reached 1000+ degrees instantly. Result: "Popped" wiresGap: - No Reusability of the nichrome deployment system making it difficult for tests and adds risks in deployment.- No Battery Monitoring or Continuity Feedback to ground control.Avionics bay from FYP-20-1 Commercial E-Match igniter Test

 Literature Review: The Crimson Powder ProblemFirst N4 Poptest ImageStructural &amp; Power Failures:Battery Holders: Standard spring-loaded holders suffer mechanical resonance and breakage under high shock loads, leading to momentary power loss (MCU Reset).FC Mounting: Rigid mounting transmits high-frequency vibrations directly to the PCB, causing solder fatigue and sensor noise.Identified Research Gaps:Quantifiable Charge Energy: Lack of empirical data correlating Charge Mass (g) to Ejection Force (N) for the N4 airframe volume.Ruggedized Avionics Structure: Absence of a shock-isolated Flight Computer (FC) Holder designed specifically to withstand the high-impact forces of pyrotechnic deployment.From pop tests it was observed that there is unpredictable pressurization of the explosion chamber leading to unforeseen issues.
