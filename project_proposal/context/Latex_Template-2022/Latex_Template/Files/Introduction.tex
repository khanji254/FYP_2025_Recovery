\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This document is supposed to help the students learn how to structure their reports. Some parts may therefore not make sense, such as the references.
A Stethoscope is an acoustic medical device used for auscultation of internal body sounds \cite{Banks2005}. The word stethoscope is derived from the two Greek words; \textit{Stethos} meaning Chest and \textit{Scopos} meaning Examination. It is not only used for heart sounds but also used to listen to lung sounds, bowel movements and pulse noises in the arteries and veins. The stethoscope is perhaps the most iconic device associated with medical practice. A 2012 research paper claimed that the stethoscope, when compared to other medical equipment, had the highest positive impact on the perceived trustworthiness of the practitioner seen with it \cite{ebeling}.\\
%Heart auscultation is the process of listening and interpreting these heart sounds. This is the most common method of cardiac diagnosis since it is inexpensive, non-intrusive and has no long term side eects as compared to other methods such as imaging using x-rays. A healthy adult has two normal heart sounds: S1 and S2. S1 occurs during the Systolic phase where the ventricles contract and pump blood into the arteries thus causing a sudden closing of the atrioventricular valves hence producing S1. While S2 occurs during the diastolic phase where the ventricles begin to relax, causing a brief back ow of blood into the heart making the semilunar valves to snap shut thus producing S2.
\subsection{Abnomalities}
However, there could be abnormalities by having other heart sounds apart from S1 and S2; which are S3 and S4. S3 is caused by a deceleration of blood ow which correlates to a volume overload in the ventricles \cite{iso22400}. This is a sign of the High Blood Pressure condition. S4 on the other hand is caused by the vibration of valves, supporting structures and the ventricular walls; which is a symptom of heart failure. These abnormalities are usually detectable since they vary in
frequency and duration from the normal S1 and S2. According to Macchi and Fumagalli \cite{macchi1}, presence of unusual heart murmurs may also be detected as abnormalities since they mainly arise from heart problems and diseases. Chen \cite{chen} stated that during heart auscultation, medics look for these abnormalities and unusual murmurs. This can be achieved using a Stethoscope.

\subsubsection{S1 and S2}
According to Macchi and Fumagalli \cite{macchi1}, presence of unusual heart murmurs may also be detected as abnormalities since they mainly arise from heart problems and diseases.

\subsubsection{S3 and S4}
This is a sign of the High Blood Pressure condition. S4 on the other hand is caused by the vibration of valves, supporting structures and the ventricular walls; which is a symptom of heart failure. These abnormalities are usually detectable since they vary in
frequency and duration from the normal S1 and S2.

\subsection{Recap}
As can be seen here, we are repeating ourselves. his is a sign of the High Blood Pressure condition. S4 on the other hand is caused by the vibration of valves, supporting structures and the ventricular walls; which is a symptom of heart failure. These abnormalities are usually detectable since they vary in
frequency and duration from the normal S1 and S2.
\subsubsection{S5 and S6}
According to Macchi and Fumagalli \cite{macchi1}, presence of unusual heart murmurs may also be detected as abnormalities since they mainly arise from heart problems and diseases.
%
\subsubsection{S7 and S8}
This is a sign of the High Blood Pressure condition. S4 on the other hand is caused by the vibration of valves, supporting structures and the ventricular walls; which is a symptom of heart failure. These abnormalities are usually detectable since they vary in
frequency and duration from the normal S1 and S2.
