\section*{Acknowledgment}
I will acknowledge you later. For now, it is assumed that by now you know how to work in the latex environment. You will therefore be expected to correct the document by removing the first page that is blank. Thereafter, you will replace the university logo with the correct one. Create your own .bib file and use it in your text. Appendices can be appended. Look up the process of adding appendices to your document.As for the rest of the sectioning, remember the key differences between a proposal and a report. As usual, some students will not even see these instructions, let alone read! Do not be one of them.  Wishing you all the best with your project.
