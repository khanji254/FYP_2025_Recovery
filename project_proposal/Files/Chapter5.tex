\section{Expected Outcomes}
\label{sec:outcomes}

\subsection{An Improved Coffee Berry Sorting Machine Model}

The outcome of this project will be a modified and improved coffee berry sorting machine that builds upon the existing prototype architecture. The improvements made will address identified limitations in image clarity, processing throughput, and system reliability.

\subsection{Enhanced Real-Time Detection and Classification Performance}

The proposed modifications will reduce motion blur and processing delays through an optimized camera configuration, improved lighting, refined image pre-processing methods, and timing-aware ejection scheduling. These enhancements will support classification and sorting at higher throughput levels without compromising accuracy.

The improved system will employ an efficient sorting algorithm that uses color, shape, and surface quality parameters to categorize coffee berries as acceptable or defective, thereby minimizing misclassification rates and improving overall sorting quality.

\subsection{Optimized Ejection Timing and Synchronization}

By integrating object tracking into the control logic, the system will achieve better alignment between detection, classification, and actuation. This integration will minimize the occurrence of missed ejections, false rejections, and actuation timing errors, resulting in a more reliable sorting process.

\subsection{Improved System Stability and Reliability}

The refinement of the mechanical and electrical modules will contribute to enhanced system stability. The improved machine will be able to operate continuously without frequent interruptions, contributing to consistent throughput and reduced maintenance downtime.

\subsection{A Scalable and Cost-Conscious Design Framework}

The project will demonstrate that it is possible to optimize the use of existing Raspberry Pi 3 resources through strategic task distribution and the introduction of low-cost co-processing elements. This framework will provide pathways for future scalability, whether through hardware upgrades or algorithmic improvements.

\subsection{Contribution to Agricultural Automation Research}

This project will contribute to the ongoing development of low-cost, image-based automated sorting systems in agricultural contexts. It will provide a practical case study on how cost-effective embedded systems can be adapted to meet the real-time processing demands of sorting applications in small-scale Kenyan agricultural settings.
