The N4 rocket mission represents a critical advancement in student rocketry, requiring a reliable dual recovery system capable of preserving flight data and hardware integrity. This project addresses three fundamental reliability challenges: telemetry range limitations leading to signal loss, uncontrolled heat generation from DC dump ignition methods causing single-use deployment systems, and absence of real-time pre-flight feedback on critical system parameters. 

The proposed solution integrates the Digi XBee-PRO 900HP telemetry system for robust long-range data transmission exceeding 5km, implements a PWM-controlled ignition system to regulate Nichrome wire temperature and enable reusable deployment, and develops a comprehensive feedback monitoring system transmitting real-time battery voltage and igniter continuity to ground control. Additionally, a sealed explosion cap design prevents thermal damage to the parachute canopy while ensuring consistent deployment, and a custom 3D-printed avionics holder provides vibration isolation under high-G launch forces. 

Expected outcomes include operational telemetry with less than 5\% packet loss at 5km altitude, zero thermal damage to recovery systems, and automatic launch inhibit protocols for critical power failures. This comprehensive approach addresses identified research gaps in student rocket recovery systems and establishes a foundation for future high-power rocketry missions.
