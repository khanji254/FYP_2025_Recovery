\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This proposal has outlined a structured approach to modifying and improving an existing automated coffee berry sorting machine. Through the introduction of a co-processing architecture alongside the Raspberry Pi 3, the proposed design seeks to overcome the computational and throughput limitations experienced in the current system. The improved mechanical, electrical, and software modules will enhance real-time image processing, classification performance, and ejection timing, thereby supporting more reliable and efficient sorting operations.

The project emphasizes a balance between technological advancement and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that the improvements remain suitable for small-scale agricultural applications. By demonstrating how affordable embedded hardware platforms can be optimized through strategic task distribution and algorithmic refinement, this work aims to contribute to the feasibility of high-performance automated agricultural sorting systems using cost-effective resources.
