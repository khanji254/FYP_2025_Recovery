\label{sec:methodology}

\subsection{Project Objectives}

\subsubsection{Main Objective}

To design and fabricate a reliable dual recovery system for the N4 rocket with extended telemetry range, ensuring mission success through enhanced communication capabilities, controlled deployment mechanisms, and comprehensive real-time monitoring systems.

\subsubsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement Digi XBee-PRO 900HP telemetry system for robust long-range data transmission exceeding 5km with <5\% packet loss
    \item Design and validate PWM-controlled ignition system for regulating nichrome wire temperature
    \item Develop comprehensive feedback monitoring system for battery percentage and deployment pin continuity
    \item Implement sealed explosion cap design for consistent parachute deployment
    \item Design ruggedized 3D-printed avionics holder with vibration isolation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Approach}

The project employs systematic design-build-test methodology \cite{student_rocket_design}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Requirements Analysis: Define system specifications based on N4 mission profile
    \item Conceptual Design: Develop solution architectures
    \item Detailed Design: Create CAD models and circuit schematics
    \item Prototyping: Fabricate components
    \item Testing and Validation: Conduct ground and flight tests
    \item Iteration: Refine designs based on results
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementation Methodology}

\subsubsection{Mechanical System Design}

\paragraph{Sealed Explosion Cap}
Sealed explosion cap houses Crimson Powder pyrotechnic charge, containing combustion products while directing pressure for deployment \cite{nakka_crimson}. High-temperature resistant materials withstand combustion while enabling multiple test cycles.

\paragraph{Avionics Bay Structure}
Custom 3D-printed PETG holder secures flight computer, LiPo batteries, and BMS with vibration isolation \cite{avionics_vibration}. Design maintains center of gravity stability under high-G loads.

\subsubsection{Electrical System Architecture}

\paragraph{Hardware Components}
ESP32 dual-core microcontroller processes telemetry data \cite{esp32_datasheet}. XBee-PRO 900HP module provides 5+km range at 900 MHz \cite{xbee_pro_datasheet}. Custom PCB eliminates loose connections \cite{embedded_flight_computers}.

\paragraph{PWM Ignition Control}
MOSFET-based PWM driver controls nichrome wire heating, preventing burnout while enabling reusable testing \cite{pwm_ignition_systems}.

\paragraph{Power Management}
BMS monitors LiPo battery health \cite{lipo_aerospace, bms_systems}. Real-time feedback transmits battery voltage and igniter continuity. Launch inhibit activates below 14.0V threshold.

\subsection{Testing and Validation Plan}

\subsubsection{Ground Testing Protocol}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Telemetry range testing at 5+ km distances
    \item PWM ignition characterization with thermal imaging
    \item Explosion cap deployment force measurements
    \item Vibration testing on shake table (15G+)
    \item Full system integration verification
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Flight Testing Protocol}
Progressive testing: low-altitude validation flights before full mission profile.
