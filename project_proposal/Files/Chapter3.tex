\label{sec:objectives}

\subsection{Main Objective}

To design and fabricate a reliable dual recovery system for the N4 rocket with extended telemetry range, ensuring mission success through enhanced communication capabilities, controlled deployment mechanisms, and comprehensive real-time monitoring systems.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

The main objective will be achieved through the following specific objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To implement the Digi XBee-PRO 900HP telemetry system for robust long-range data transmission exceeding 5km with less than 5\% packet loss.
    
    \item To design and validate a PWM-controlled ignition system capable of regulating Nichrome wire temperature, preventing burnout while enabling reusable deployment testing.
    
    \item To develop a comprehensive feedback monitoring system that transmits real-time battery percentage and deployment pin continuity status to the ground station.
    
    \item To implement a sealed explosion cap design that ensures consistent and reliable parachute deployment while preventing thermal damage to the canopy.
    
    \item To design and fabricate a ruggedized 3D-printed avionics holder providing vibration isolation and maintaining center of gravity stability under high-G launch forces.
\end{enumerate}

Each specific objective addresses identified failure modes from previous missions and contributes to the overall system reliability required for successful mission completion.
